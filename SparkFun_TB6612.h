TB6612FNG H-Bridge Motor Driver Example code

Uses 2 motors to show examples of the functions in the library.  This causes
a robot to do a little 'jig'.  Each movement has an equal and opposite movement
so assuming your motors are balanced the bot should end up at the same place it
started.

Development environment specifics:
Developed on Arduino 1.6.4
Developed with ROB-9457
